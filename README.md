## Description 
Welcome to our project! This is an AI-based application and website to solve the problems faced by tour guides and tourists in the tourism industry. Our solution is to provide a mobile app and website as a tour guide that offers tourists information about tourism in Egypt and the history of landmarks, using innovative technology such as OCR for text recognition, CV for landmark detection, and a chatbot for guidance. With our solution, we aim to enhance the tourists' experience and satisfaction and make their trip to Egypt easier and more enjoyable.

## What our platform can do 
* provide tourists with guidance and information about their surroundings with chatbot.
* recognize and convert text on images captured by tourists from Arabic to English.
* detect landmarks in images captured by tourists.
